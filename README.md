## Overview
The Human Violence Detection project is an innovative system designed to detect instances of violence in real-time using computer vision technology. The system employs a camera to continuously monitor the surroundings and analyze frames to identify violent actions. Key features include real-time detection, frame-by-frame analysis, and automated alerting through a connected Telegram bot, providing swift notifications to a designated security firm for prompt action.

## Key Features
1. Real-time Detection:
Utilizing advanced computer vision algorithms, the system can promptly identify instances of violence as they occur. The camera continuously captures frames and processes them in real-time to detect violent behavior, ensuring immediate recognition and response.

3. Frame-by-Frame Analysis:
Each frame captured by the camera undergoes meticulous analysis to assess the presence of violent actions. By evaluating sequences of frames within a buffer, the system employs a comprehensive approach to confirm the occurrence of violence before triggering an alert.

4. Telegram Bot Integration:
Upon detecting a violent frame or a series of frames indicating violence, the system uploads the identified frame(s) to a connected Telegram bot. This bot serves as a direct communication channel to a designated security firm or relevant authorities. The automated alerting mechanism enables swift notification and response to potential threats or incidents.
